# Voice-Enabled Text Reader for Visually Impaired üó£Ô∏èüìñ

This project presents a cost-effective, offline, and highly flexible voice-enabled text reader designed to assist visually impaired individuals in independently reading printed or handwritten text. The system leverages **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** technologies on a low-power, embedded platform, the **Raspberry Pi 5**. This solution aims to overcome the limitations of expensive, cloud-dependent alternatives by providing a reliable, real-time, and accessible tool.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Fully Offline Operation:** No internet connection is required, ensuring accessibility in all environments.
  * **Multilingual Support:** High-accuracy OCR for **English**, **Kannada**, and **Telugu** scripts.
  * **Real-time Processing:** Optimized to provide instant audio feedback from a live camera feed.
  * **Enhanced Image Preprocessing:** Includes techniques like CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) and Gaussian blur to improve text recognition in various lighting conditions and with degraded images.
  * **Text Refinement:** Incorporates spell correction and text normalization for improved readability and accuracy.
  * **Rule-Based Transliteration:** A custom-built transliteration model for Indic scripts ensures correct pronunciation for a more natural-sounding voice output.
  * **Lightweight and Portable:** Built on the Raspberry Pi 5 platform, making the device compact and easy to carry.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system follows a structured, end-to-end process:

1.  **Image Capture:** A USB webcam continuously captures a real-time video feed.
2.  **Image Preprocessing:** Each frame is converted to grayscale, and advanced techniques like CLAHE and Gaussian blur are applied to enhance contrast and reduce noise.
3.  **Text Extraction:** The preprocessed image is fed into the **EasyOCR** engine, which uses a two-stage deep learning architecture (**CRAFT** for text detection and **CRNN** for recognition) to accurately extract the text.
4.  **Language Detection:** The system automatically identifies the language of the extracted text (English, Telugu, or Kannada) using Unicode character ranges.
5.  **Transliteration & Refinement:** For Indic scripts, a rule-based transliteration module converts the text into a phonetic English representation. Text is also refined using spell-checking and normalization.
6.  **Speech Synthesis:** The processed text is sent to the **pyttsx3** TTS engine, which generates natural-sounding speech output without any internet connection.
7.  **Looping Mechanism:** After the audio is played, the system seamlessly returns to the capture stage to process new text, enabling continuous reading.
